# Lost Cities

#### What?
A simple website app for storing and calculating scores in [Lost Cities](https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/50/lost-cities) card game.  

#### What's already done
- storing scores for each of five expeditions in each of three games and calculating summary score
- displaying names of players on the top of the score table
- displaying icons of sites in different order for both players

#### Future ideas
- "restart scores" button
- change colour of players' names
- swap the order of icons for players
- "hide/show final results" button
- (tidy up website directory and shrink icons)
